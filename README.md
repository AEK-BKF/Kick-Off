### CSS Styles

All the layouts are only using UIkit default styles, no extra css it´s added to keep things clean and simple.

The css styles are the minified latest version of UIKit 3 ( currently 3.0.0-beta.39 ) from the cdn, you can find it here.
HTML

The code try to be as simple as possible, with commented sections, validated and semantic html5 markup.

### JS

Since UIkit 3 removed JQuery dependancy, it´s not included. All JS implementations are created by adding `data-uk-*` attributes to the HTML elements. No additional JS lines are added.

The `uikit.min.js` file is the minified latest version of UIKit 3 ( currently 3.0.0-beta.39 ) from the cdn, you can find it here.

The `data-uk-*` syntax it´s used in order to work with every library and get html code validated.

### Components
